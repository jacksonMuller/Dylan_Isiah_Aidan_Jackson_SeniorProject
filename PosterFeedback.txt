Great work on the poster!

I think I mentioned in class that you'll need to put "CMSI 4071" and "Spring 2025" on there somewhere.

Do that and you'll be good to go.  Send a completed copy to Masao for printing.  His e-mail address is:

     Masao.Kitamura@lmu.edu

Make sure to put a copy into your repository as well.

sorry, I forgot to mention that your poster needs to be a PDF file,
   NOT a PNG file.  Also, double check the size to make sure it is
   48 inches wide by 36 inches tall.

THEN you can send it to Masao....
