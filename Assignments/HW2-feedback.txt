You demonstrate a strong understanding of Agile principles and software
   development practices, with clear reasoning and practical examples.
   Strengths include accurate definitions, thoughtful opinions on assumptions
   and estimates, and well-articulated contrasts between Agile and Waterfall.
   Areas for improvement include refining terminology for Agile phases,
   explicitly connecting answers to Agile practices (e.g., planning poker,
   INVEST criteria), and correcting the fill-in-the-blank error for Planning
   Poker.  Adding references to common tools and best practices would further
   enhance completeness.  Overall, this is a well-prepared and insightful
   assignment with only some minor refinements suggested.

nice work!
