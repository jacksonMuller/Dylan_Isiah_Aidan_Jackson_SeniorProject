Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Poker Face
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
Well done on the proposal document!  This is a very interesting project and
will be quite a challenge!  I'm impressed by what you are taking on and I'm
glad to see a project that integrates hardware with the software since there
are engineering components of both that will go into this system.  You have
defined the focus of the project well, even if you haven't defined the task
the arm will accomplish, and there are MANY uses for this system.

Your justification section is very good, too.  You have situated the project
well in its context and have described the high points of your involvement
with the technologies you'll be using.  Knowing that there is a distinct
learning curve and identifying the topics you'll be learning as you go is
great information as well as demonstrating the thought you are putting into
the effort.

The only thing I would change is, you don't need to include the assignment
statements before the two sections.  The project documentation is supposed
to be similar to what you would do in an industry document, so that text
would not appear.  Otherwise, good work!


Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  I like your
graphics, even though none of them is really about robotics or computer
vision ~ they are interesting and engaging, though!

Overall, very good!

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

5 out of 5 which is an A-plus on this deliverable.
