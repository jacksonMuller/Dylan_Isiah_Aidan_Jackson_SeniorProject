Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths
      Clear major CSC divisions.
      Each CSC includes meaningful subcomponents.
   Suggestions
      Add a brief description explaining why each CSC boundary exists.
      Include a diagram or data-flow explanation.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Requirements are observable and testable.
      Good coverage of all operational system behaviors.
   Suggestions
      Some requirements could use quantification (e.g., allowable detection
         failure rates, minimum supported object classes).
      Minor gaps: error‑handling behaviors, calibration failure cases, and
         user‑input edge cases could be more explicitly defined.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Metrics (FPS, seconds, centimeters) are clear and testable.
      Covers timing, precision, and safety.
   Suggestions
      Could define maximum tolerances (e.g., max variance in response time).
      Could include long‑duration stability or thermal‑performance metrics.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths
      Clear software toolchain and hardware list.
      Realistic for development and deployment.
   Suggestions
      Could add expected filesystem layout, required permissions, and
         dependency‑version stability.
      Could specify calibration environment assumptions (lighting, space).

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown               1.0/1
   Functional Requirements           3.9/4
   Performance Requirements          2.0/2
   Environment Requirements          1.0/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                          7.9/8
   Preliminary Schedule              2.0/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9.9/10 = 99% which is an A-plus

You've met most of the desired measurements for this deliverable.  Your SRS
is very well done but could benefit from at least incorporating a few of
the suggestions to make it even more complete, like the minor gaps listed
in the Functional section.

Nice work on this deliverable ~ keep up the good work!
