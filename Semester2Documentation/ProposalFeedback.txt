Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Schedulr
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      You clearly explain that the project is a robotic arm with computer
      vision that will organize objects on a desk, and describe the current
      status (3D-printed arm, servos, Raspberry Pi) from last semester.
      Additionally, the changes planned for this semester (CV integration,
      inverse kinematics, ROS2 integration) are well-described, along with
      planned stretch goals.  You have a clear explanation of technical
      components, your feature roadmap is well-defined, and your explanation
      of target use and purpose is implied.

   Justification:
      You clearly express that your team enjoys robotics and wants to see
      the project through.  You have a good connection to previous
      coursework and honestly address the technical difficulty with a
      thoughtful team feasiblity assessment.  This is strong justification.

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      Awesome job on the slides again.  I like the mix of solid color
      slides with open-background and graphics.  Keeps it interesting.\!



Summary:
--------

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.  Will update after video is posted.


VIDEO EVALUATION
================
Very good presentation!  I like the way you divided up the speaking parts so
that everyone got to talk.  You all definitely seemed to be talking from your
own knowledge rather than a script.  You included a good motivation for the
continuation of the project, and were clear on what you will add.

Nice work on this.  Five out of Five points on this deliverable.
