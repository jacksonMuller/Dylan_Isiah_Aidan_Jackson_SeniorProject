Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Schedulr
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      You clearly explain that the project is a robotic arm with computer
      vision that will organize objects on a desk, and describe the current
      status (3D-printed arm, servos, Raspberry Pi) from last semester.
      Additionally, the changes planned for this semester (CV integration,
      inverse kinematics, ROS2 integration) are well-described, along with
      planned stretch goals.  You have a clear explanation of technical
      components, your feature roadmap is well-defined, and your explanation
      of target use and purpose is implied.

   Justification:
      You clearly express that your team enjoys robotics and wants to see
      the project through.  You have a good connection to previous
      coursework and honestly address the technical difficulty with a
      thoughtful team feasiblity assessment.  This is strong justification.
