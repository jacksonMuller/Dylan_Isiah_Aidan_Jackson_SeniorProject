==========================================

Overall Impression
Section 6.3 is well-structured and includes class descriptions, interface
details, data structures, and design diagrams.  It reflects an Agile-style
implementation detail (Python modules, OpenCV, keyboard teleop) but also
aligns with Waterfall expectations for detailed design.  However, some
formal elements (traceability, diagrams, algorithm pseudo-code) are
missing for full Waterfall compliance.

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   This section is subsumed by the following sections

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Each class (e.g., VisionSystem, DetectedObject, ServoController,
         KeyboardTeleop, PositionSequencer) includes:
            Purpose
            Key Responsibilities
            Key Fields
            Key Methods
      Responsibilities are clearly tied to functional roles
         (camera handling, object detection, servo control,
         teleoperation).
      Covers both perception and control CSCs, showing modular
         decomposition.
   Suggestions:
      Add visibility and relationships
         (public/private, inheritance, composition).
      Include state diagrams or lifecycle notes for dynamic components
         (e.g., VisionSystem main loop).
      Explicitly link each class to requirement IDs for traceability.
      Document error handling strategies (e.g., camera failure,
         servo disconnect).
      Provide algorithm pseudo-code for complex methods like getObjects()
         and motion sequencing.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Interfaces between major components are described:
         VisionSystem -> consumers (detections)
         KeyboardTeleop -> ServoController (keypress-triggered joint offsets)
         External assets (model files) are noted.
   Suggestions:
      Provide formal interface tables listing:
         Method signatures
         Input/output types
         Error conditions
      Include sequence diagrams for critical flows
         (e.g., detection -> teleop -> servo command).
      Document data transfer protocols (e.g., synchronous vs asynchronous,
         message format).

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Defines key structures:
         Joint Command (name/id + Goal_Position offset)
         Detection (label, confidence, bbox, center)
         Sequence File (positions, timing)
         Model Assets (config, weights)
      Clear mapping to functional components.
   Suggestions:
      Add data type specifications (e.g., int, float, string).
      Include validation rules (e.g., position range limits,
         confidence thresholds).
      Provide serialization format (JSON or CSV examples for
         sequence files).
      Document cardinality and relationships
         (e.g., one sequence -> many positions).

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Strengths:
      Mentions diagrams, but actual diagrams are missing
         (only a placeholder image).
      Indicates no database, which is appropriate for this system.
   Suggestions:
      Add class diagrams showing relationships among CSUs.
      Include sequence diagrams for runtime interactions
         (e.g., teleop loop).
      Provide component diagrams for CSC-level architecture.
      If applicable, add state diagrams for VisionSystem and
         ServoController.
